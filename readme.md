# GMT211 GitHub Tutorial

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Git and GitHub for version control. It includes a Python script for handling coordinates and an image.

## Git Commands Used
| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `git init` | Initializes a new Git repository |
| `git add .` | Stages all changes in the directory for the next commit |
| `git commit -m "your commit message"` | Commits the staged changes with a message |
| `git push origin master` | Pushes the committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub |
| `git pull origin master` | Pulls the latest changes from the remote repository |

## Local Git Workflow vs GitHub Workflow
- **Local Git Workflow**: Involves using Git commands to manage version control on your local machine. You can create commits, branches, and merge changes without needing an internet connection.
- **GitHub Workflow**: Involves pushing your local changes to a remote repository on GitHub. This allows for collaboration with others, as they can pull your changes, review them, and contribute their own changes.

## Difficulties Encountered
During this process, I encountered the following difficulties:
- Understanding the difference between local and remote repositories.
- Resolving merge conflicts when multiple people edited the same file.
- Remembering the correct sequence of Git commands.

## Commit Decisions
I decided to make a commit whenever:
- A significant feature was added or a bug was fixed.
- A logical unit of work was completed.
- Before pulling changes from the remote repository to avoid conflicts.

## Use of AI
I benefited from the use of AI in the following ways:
- AI-assisted code completion and suggestions helped speed up the coding process.
- AI provided explanations and examples for Git commands and workflows.

## Interaction with AI
I used GitHub Copilot to assist with this project. Through this interaction, I learned how to effectively use Git and GitHub for version control, and how AI can enhance productivity by providing contextual code suggestions and explanations.
